# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis

This repository contains analysis of pizza sales data using SQL and Power BI. The objective of this project is to extract insights from transaction data and assist in business decisions.

## 📊 Project Overview

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of pizza sales data to answer key business questions, such as:
1. Which pizza has the highest and lowest sales? What category does it belong to?
2. What pizza size is preferred by customers?
3. What are the sales trends by month?
4. Are there specific hours that show the highest pizza sales?
5. What is the most favorite pizza each month?

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **SQL**: For data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

## 📈 Key Insights

The following insights were derived from the analysis:
1. Identify the most and least purchased pizza menu within one year. 
2. Identifying customer preferences in determining pizza size.
3. Knowing the months with the highest and lowest pizza sales can help businesses prepare appropriate marketing strategies.
4. Knowing the peak hours of serving customers allows businesses to ensure enough staff to improve efficiency and service.
